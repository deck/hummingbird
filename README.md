# What is it?

`LowMagic::Migrations` is a way to write SQL migrations in SQL, and
provide some minimal tooling around running these migrations against a
DB.

# Why is it?

DSLs that abstract away the differences in databases can be nice to
work with, but they often cater to something resembling the lowest
common denominator amongst those databases.
